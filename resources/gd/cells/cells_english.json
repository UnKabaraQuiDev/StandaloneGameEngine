You killed a fungal cell!
Fungal cells have a rigid cell wall
made of chitin. They act as
decomposers, breaking down dead
organic material. Fungi reproduce
through spores and are more closely
related to animals than plants!

You've been killed by a fungal cell!
Fungal cells are known for their
rigid cell walls made of chitin.
They decompose dead organic material
and reproduce through spores.
Interestingly, fungi are more closely
related to animals than to plants!

You killed a virus!
Viruses consist of a protein coat
surrounding genetic material. They
infect host cells to replicate and
spread. Unable to reproduce on their
own, viruses hijack a host cell's
machinery. They exist on the edge
of living and non-living things 
ecause they need a host to survive!

You've been killed by a virus!
Viruses are made up of a protein
coat surrounding genetic material.
They infect host cells and use them
to replicate and spread. Viruses can't
reproduce independently and must
hijack a host cell's machinery. They
blur the line between living and
non-living things because they
require a host to survive!

You killed a bacterial cell!
Bacterial cells have a simple
structure without a nucleus and a
cell wall made of peptidoglycan.
They can be beneficial or harmful.
Bacteria reproduce asexually through
binary fission and are among the
oldest life forms on Earth!

You've been killed by a bacterial cell!
Bacterial cells feature a simple
structure without a nucleus and a
cell wall made of peptidoglycan.
They can be either beneficial or
harmful. Bacteria reproduce asexually
through binary fission and have existed
for billions of years as some of the
oldest life forms on Earth!
